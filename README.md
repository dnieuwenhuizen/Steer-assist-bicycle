# Steer-assist-bicycle
In this repository the code of the steer assist bicycle of my thesis can be found.

Main_program consists of the steer rate controller on the steer assist bicycle. 

The main_program makes use of several libraries: MPU9250.h, Encoder.h, MadgwickAHRS.h, SdFat.h, Filters.h and math.h 
make sure these libraries are included when you are running in Arduino. The libraries can be downloaded direclty from this repository
and should be put in the libraries folder of the Arduino IDE. See the exmamples of the libraries to see how they work.
